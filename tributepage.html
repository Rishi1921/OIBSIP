     <p>Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam was brought into the world to an unfortunate Tamil Muslim family. He resided with his family in the sanctuary city of Tamilnadu, Rameswaram, where his dad, Jainulabdeen, had a boat and was an imam of a nearby mosque. Simultaneously, his mom, Ashiamma, was a housewife. Kalam had four siblings and one sister in his family, from which he was the most youthful. Kalam's progenitors were rich merchants and landowners and had tremendous land and property lots. In any case, with time, their business of shipping travelers and exchanging basic food items experienced colossal misfortunes because of the Pamban Extension's opening. Subsequently, Kalam's family had become lacking and battled hard to earn enough to pay the bills. At a youthful age, Kalam needed to offer papers to enhance his family pay.</p>
